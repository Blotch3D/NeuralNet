# NeuralNet
A full neural network implementation written from scratch (i.e. no library is used) for demonstration purposes so you can watch the inner workings. You can configure any neuron connections you want.
Run 'TestNeuralNet' for a demo. There are several different data sets coded in that file that you can train for. A graphical display of the net shows real time weights, biases, and connections while it's training. 

See program.cs in the TestNeuralNet project for an example of how to train and use it.
