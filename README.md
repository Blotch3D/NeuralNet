# NeuralNet
A bare bones concept neural net for demonstration purposes, but not so much performance.
Run 'TestNeuralNet' for a demo. There are several different soutions you can train for. A graphical display of the net shows real time parameters while it's training. 

See program.cs in TestNeuralNet for an example of how to train and use it.
