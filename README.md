# NeuralNet
A full, basic neural net implementation for demonstration purposes (i.e. uses no library).
Run 'TestNeuralNet' for a demo. There are several different data sets you can train for. A graphical display of the net shows real time parameters while it's training. 

See program.cs in TestNeuralNet for an example of how to train and use it.
