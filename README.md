# NeuralNet
A neural network implementation written from scratch (i.e. no ML library is used) that graphically diplays the network structure, weights, and biases while it is training.

You can configure any network shape, but convolution networks are not displayed well graphically.

Run 'TestNeuralNet' for a demo. There are several different data sets coded in that file that you can train for--just uncomment the training set you want to experiment with. 

See program.cs in the TestNeuralNet project for an example of how to train and use it.
